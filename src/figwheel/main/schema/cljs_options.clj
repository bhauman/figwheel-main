(def-spec-meta ::modules
  :doc
  "A new option for emitting Google Closure Modules. Closure Modules
supports splitting up an optimized build into N different modules. If
:modules is supplied it replaces the single :output-to. A module needs
a name, an individual :output-to file path, :entries a set of
namespaces, and :depends-on a set of modules on which the module
depends. Modules are only supported with :simple and :advanced
optimizations. An example follows:

  {:optimizations :advanced
   :source-map true
   :output-dir \"resources/public/js\"
   :modules {
     :common
       {:output-to \"resources/public/js/common.js\"
        :entries #{\"com.foo.common\"}}
     :landing
       {:output-to \"resources/public/js/landing.js\"
        :entries #{\"com.foo.landing\"}
        :depends-on #{:common}}
     :editor
       {:output-to \"resources/public/js/editor.js\"
        :entries #{\"com.foo.editor\"}
        :depends-on #{:common}}}}


Any namespaces not in an :entries set will be moved into the default
module :cljs-base. However thanks to cross module code motion, Google
Closure can move functions and methods into the modules where they are
actually used. This process is somewhat conservative so if you know
that you want to keep some code together do this via :entries.

The :cljs-base module defaults to being written out to :output-dir
with the name \"cljs_base.js\". This may be overridden by specifying a
:cljs-base module describing only :output-to.

Take careful note that a namespace may only appear once across all
module :entries.

:modules fully supports :foreign-libs. :foreign-libs are always put
into dependency order before any Google Closure compiled source.

Source maps are fully supported, an individual one will be created for
each module. Just supply :source-map true (see example) as there is no
single source map to name.")
