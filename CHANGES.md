# 0.2.7 Further NPM support

Pushed `:bundle` target support forward a bit further.

* added `:bundle-freq` figwheel-option with `:once`, `:always` and `:smart` which bundles when `output-to` or `npm_deps.js` changes
* added `:auto-bundle` figwheel-option so supply basic default bundle config
* log the bundle command and the bunder output when a bundle command fails
* added a warning to ensure the `:output-to` is inside the `:output-dir` for the bundle target
* added `--install-deps` cli support to the schema


# 0.2.6 Further NPM support for the new :bundle target

Got extra-mains and auto-testing up and running along with a new
intial docs page https://figwheel.org/docs/npm.html to help get
started with an NPM based ClojureScript project.

* Added templating to `:bundle-cmd` cljs option: it interpolates `:output-to` and `:final-output-to`
* `:bundle-cmd` only bundles one time when watching and compiling
* set the fighweel option `:bundle-once` to `false` to have bundling occur on every compile
* set the fighweel option `:final-output-to` if you don't want the default of `:output-to` + "_bundle"
* logs the bundle command when it runs for easier debugging

# 0.2.5 Much better NPM support with new CLJS :bundle target 

> support for the new :bundle target requires clojurescript >= 1.10.764

The latest ClojureScript updated the Google Closure library which
included some breaking changes when it comes to reloading. This
release fixes those problems and also fixes fighweel-main problems
that interfered with the support of the new :bundle target.

You can currently learn more about the new bundle target in the Clojruescript guide

https://clojurescript.org/guides/webpack

Using the bundle target will break auto-testing and the default index
page. You will have to have your own host page.

There still needs to be some work done on Extra mains to get them to
work properly with the new bundle target.

The main problem for many of these automated features is that figwheel
has no idea of where the output file of webpack is because the webpack
config is exterior to figwheel itself.

The new :bundle target probably deprecates the :npm-deps way of doing
things. We'll need to take some time with this way of doing things to
see what makes sense.

# 0.2.4 

* Add :open-url-wait-ms option to delay launching the browser when :open-url is enabled
* fix repl hanging on error
* get rid of another glog/warning call

# 0.2.0 Minor updates

So nothing groundbreaking in this release, just firming things up and
pushing out changes because they have sat in the repo long enough.

* bump up to ring 0.1.7
* optionaly serve static cljsjs resources see https://figwheel.org/config-options#cljsjs-resources
* experimental - support for a cross over :nodejs Extra Main target to compile a project for the browser and node -- this more than likely wont work in many cases
* change the way that figwheel.main detects whether clj is launching figwheel from a project directory
* CSS reloading improvement
* ensure not zero exit when not watching or building once
* make syntax errors log at level :warn


# 0.1.9 Testing

This release has focused on making it much easier to integrate testing
into your workflow. Auto-testing, CLI testing for dev ops integration,
and headless testing support come together to make testing a major
feature in figwheel.main.

See the testing documentation here: https://figwheel.org/docs/testing.html
See the async main script docs here: https://figwheel.org/docs/main_script.html

* auto discovery and display of tests found in your source files with `:auto-testing true`
* added async support to the `--main` CLi arg that also supports non-zero exit status
* `:launch-js` option was created to support use of headless environments during testing [Learn more](https://figwheel.org/config-options#launch-js)
* fixed regresion where `--compile --repl` didn't start a repl

# 0.1.8 Extra Mains, Much better NPM and Global exports support, Smiley!

The new `:extra-main-files` option makes integrating things like tests
and devcards to your build super simple and CPU efficient
[Learn more](https://figwheel.org/docs/extra_mains.html)

There was a long standing bug with `:global-exports` support that I
was able to squash which in turn led to changes that make working with
npm modules much easier.

The new `:npm` option will help you make quick work of integrating
webpack bundled npm modules into your
build. [Learn more](https://figwheel.org/config-options#npm)

* added `:pre-build-hooks` and `:post-build-hooks` config options [Learn more](https://figwheel.org/config-options#pre-build-hooks)
* fixed the `figwheel.main` api in the CLJS repl so that it works
  properly under nREPL
* added the `:build-inputs` config option [Learn More](https://figwheel.org/config-options#build-inputs)
* finally added the validation smiley `\\(ãƒ„)/`, I pretty much had to after I saw this [tweet](https://twitter.com/yatesco/status/1027352003868065793)

# 0.1.7 Fix for nREPL

Fixes a bug that was deleting the listeners that notified the client
to reload.

# 0.1.6 Scripting API

> update: hot reloading does not work when figwheel.main is
> started from nREPL

Added a Scripting API that allows one to start multiple builds and
then attach a REPL to any of the running builds. The API also allows
one to stop builds and obtain a repl-env from a build (this is
expecially helpful for VIM fireplace). See the `figwheel.main.api`
namespace and the docs at
[https://figwheel.org/docs/scripting_api.html](https://figwheel.org/docs/scripting_api.html)

* ignore preload link tags when reloading CSS

# 0.1.5 Windows Fix and merge multiple build-ids: `--build dev:other`

* fixed a major problem on Windows that created a bad `:asset-path` which prevented the REPL from connecting
* merge build args which allows you to supply path seperated build ids to `--build`
* allow connect-urls to not have a process-id and still connect
* change the default build name to `"unknown"` rather than common name `"dev"`
* allow the `--serve` flag after the `--build-once` flag, for testing advanced compiles and such
* throw an error when trying to start a REPL with a level other than `:optimizations :none`
* when the compile level is `:whitespace`, `:simple` or `:advanced` only pass `:main` ns to compiler
* made the default :asset-path a root path instead of relative
* add cljs.repl macros (doc, source, and friends) to the REPL
* now providing much more feedback when a `:ring-handler` doesn't load, prints out syntax errors etc.
* added support for the new nREPL https://github.com/nrepl/nREPL
* setting `:reload-clj-files false` should still reload cljc files on the CLJS side
* support code splitting

# 0.1.4 Move into own Repository

This release was only to establish https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main as the new home of com.bhauman/figwheel-main

# 0.1.3

* enable reloading of dependents, configurable with :reload-dependents
* bump rebel-readline-cljs dep to latest
* fix the helper app so that it only attempts to operate on a DOM node if it is present
* added new evalback functionality which gives the client the ability to evaluate cljs
  through the figwheel REPL connection
* fixed a problem where js/require couldn't be invoked from the REPL in Node
* ensure that repl warnings don't make it into the source code for a required ns
* added some helper content for the new figwheel-main-template
* validate that symbols in config don't start with quotes (a very common mistake)

# 0.1.2 Fix for Java 9/10 

* fix classloader bug that prevented figwheel.main from starting Java 9/10
* fix NPE when nonexistant namespace is provided as main ns

# 0.1.1 Classpath Repair, Devtools and Helper App

* fix case when target directory is on the classpath but does not
  exist, as resources will not resolve in this case
* warn when there is a `resources/public/index.html` and the `resources`
  directory is not on the classpath
* ensure that the watched directories are on the classpath
* ensure that the watched directories have source files
* ensure the directory, that the `:main` ns is in, is on the classpath
* auto include `binaryage/devtools` in opt none builds targeting the browser
* fixed bug where providing a `:ring-handler` in build metadata didn't work
* fixed bug where single compiles with the -c option were not working for optimization
  levels other than none
* add `:client-log-level` option to set the level for client side logging
* fixed problem where node target builds were launching a browser
* fixed undefined var warnings in the REPL by ensuring full analysis on REPL start
