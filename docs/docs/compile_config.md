# Compile Configuration

<div class="lead-in">The ClojureScript compiler has a dizzying number
of <a
href="https://clojurescript.org/reference/compiler-options">configuration
options</a>. However, there are really only a few key ones you need to
understand to work effectively.</div>

Figwheel handles setting up several compilation options for you, but
it's very important to understand these options, and how Figwheel uses
them to inject itself into a build. Having this knowledge will empower
you to understand how your build is working and how to adjust the
options so that they serve you better.

Here are the compiler options we'll cover:

* `--print-config`
* `:output-to`
* `:output-dir`
* `:target`
* `:optimizations`
* `:main`
* `:asset-path`
* `:preloads`
* `:closure-defines`

## The `--print-config` option

You can use the `figwheel.main` CLI option `--print-config` (or `-pc`)
to examine the compile options that Figwheel is sending to the
ClojureScript compiler. The `--print-config` CLI flag will only print
out the configuration, it will not run the command.

> It's important to note that order matters for `figwheel.main` CLI
> options. The `-pc` flag is considered an **init option** and as such
> it must always come before a **main option** (`-c`, `-b`, `-r`, `-m`
> are all main options). In the commands that we've been using so far
> in this documentation, this means it has to come **before** the `-b`
> option.

Keeping with our `hello-world.core` example let's print out the
configuration.

```shell
$ clojure -m figwheel.main -pc -b dev -r
```

The above command should print out something like the following:

```clojure
[Figwheel] :pprint-config true - printing config:
---------------------- Figwheel options ----------------------
{:pprint-config true, :mode :repl, :watch-dirs ("src")}
---------------------- Compiler options ----------------------
{:main hello-world.core,
 :output-to "target/public/cljs-out/dev-main.js",
 :output-dir "target/public/cljs-out/dev",
 :asset-path "cljs-out/dev",
 :preloads
 [figwheel.core
  figwheel.main
  figwheel.repl.preload
  devtools.preload
  figwheel.main.evalback],
 :aot-cache false,
 :closure-defines
 {figwheel.repl/connect-url
  "ws://localhost:9500/figwheel-connect?fwprocess=b96800&fwbuild=dev"},
 :repl-requires
 ([figwheel.repl :refer-macros [conns focus]]
  [figwheel.main
   :refer-macros
   [stop-builds start-builds build-once reset clean status]])}
```

As you can see there are two sections; one displaying the current
**config options for Figwheel** and one displaying the **final compile
options** to be sent to the ClojureScript compiler.

Looking at the **compiler options** you will see that while we only
supplied `{:main hello-world.core}` in our `dev.cljs.edn`, Figwheel
added a few more options. We will focus on explaining these options.

## The `:output-to` option

The `:output-to` option is "the path to the JavaScript file that will
be output". This is simple enough. You provide the `:output-to` option a path
to a file where the compiled ClojureScript should be output. This file
will always represent your main compiled artifact.

However, the contents of the file and how we load this file will vary
based on the `:optimizations`, `:main`, and `:target` options.

The most important thing to remember when working with the Figwheel
server is that the `:output-to` option needs to point to a path that
is basically the classpath + `public`.

The Figwheel default for this path is in the `target/public` directory
because we want to separate files that are compiled (and thus
temporary) from files that we edit and keep in version control like
HTML and CSS.

The Figwheel default as mentioned before uses the build name and looks
like

```shell
target/public/cljs-out/[build-name]-main.js
```

If you don't use a build file then the `:output-to` path may look like

```shell
target/public/cljs-out/main.js
```

This can lead to problems if you are using different command line
options to obtain different compilation results.

## The `:output-dir` option

The `:output-dir` sets the output directory for temporary files used
during compilation.

Regardless of the `:optimizations` level, the compiler will output a
file for each ClojureScript "namespace" in your project and all of its
dependencies, as well as the Google Closure libraries and foreign
libraries that are utilized.

If you have a `hello-world.core` example you can examine the
`:output-dir` after a compile and see the temporary files:

```shell
target/public/cljs-out/dev
├── cljs
│   ├── core.cljs
│   ├── core.js
│   ├── core.js.map
│   ├── pprint.cljs
│   ├── pprint.cljs.cache.json
│   ├── pprint.js
│   ├── pprint.js.map
│   ├── stacktrace.cljc
│   ├── stacktrace.cljc.cache.json
│   ├── stacktrace.js
│   ├── stacktrace.js.map
... a lot more
```

These files also serve as a cache for the compiler which enables
incremental compiles. If your source file has a timestamp newer than
the file in the output directory, then the compiler will compile the
source file. Caches can get stale however and you will want to **delete
your output directory on a regular basis**.

When no `:output-dir` is defined, Figwheel will provide a default
`:output-dir` which will have the form:

```
target/public/cljs-out/[build-name]
```

For example the default `:output-dir` for our `dev.cljs.edn` build
file will be `target/public/cljs-out/dev`.

You may notice that the `:output-dir` path is placed so that its
contents are available via the classpath. The reason for this is
because when we use the default `:optimizations` level `:none` many of
these "temporary files" are directly loaded into our client
environment. For example, in a web environment when we load our
`:output-to` file, the Google Closure base code will calculate the
files that need loading and then load them in order. Hence the browser
needs to serve these files and this is why they need to be available on
the classpath.

So if you choose to customize the `:output-dir` path keep in mind that
they will need to be found by the client environment if you are using
`:optimizations :none`.

But ... you should never put the `:output-dir` directly on the
classpath. This means if `target` is in the classpath, you should
never set `:output-dir` to the `target` directory. If you do this you
are making your compiled artifacts resolvable by the CLJS
compiler. This means that when the CLJS compiler looks for a required
CLJS file it will possibly find it in the `target` directory and this
will cause major problems.

## The `:optimizations` option

The `:optimizations` compiler option designates the optimizations
level that the Google Closure compiler should use. The available
optimization levels are:

* `:none` - the default level, no code optimizations
* `:whitespace` - basically just removes whitespace and comments
* `:simple` - removes whitespace and shortens local variable names
* `:advanced` - more aggressive renaming, dead code removal, global
  inlining

The Figwheel `--build` option and the ClojureScript REPL both require
`:optimizations` to be set to `:none`. `:none` is the default so it
does not need to be specified in the configuration options map.

As we noted before the `:none` level does not produce a single
self-contained compiled artifact, but rather creates an artifact that
loads all of the separately compiled namespaces.

All the other levels (`:whitespace`, `:simple`, and `:advanced`)
produce a single compiled artifact to the `:output-to` file. These are
often used for producing your final deployable asset when you use
these optimizations settings.

The `:advanced` level provides absolutely amazing compression and
optimization but it is also the most finicky. This
[guide][advanced-guide] can be helpful.

## The `:main` option

The `:main` option specifies an entry point (root namespace) for your
compiled artifact. When `:optimizations` is `:none` the `:main` option
will cause the compiler to generate a file that will in turn load all
the files that are needed by the `:main` namespace. Actually, it does
more than this. It adds all the `:closure-defines` that we have
specified in our configuration, and requires all of the `:preloads`.

The `:main` option bootstraps your client environment and as such it
behaves differently depending on the `:target` option.

Figwheel does not have a default for the `:main` option and requires
that you provide a namespace value.

You can provide a symbol or a string, and it needs to be a namespace
that is available in your source path directories that are on the
classpath.

The example we have been using in this documentation has been:

```clojure
:main hello-world.core
```
## The `:asset-path` option

This only affects the build if you are using the `:main` option with
`:optimizations :none`. The generated bootstrap script in the
`:output-to` file needs to know the path to your temporary files in
`:output-dir`. This path is relative to your webroot.

As you can see above in the compile options for our example
`hello-world.core` project our `:asset-path` is this:

```clojure
:asset-path "cljs-out/dev"
```

Basically you can think of the `:asset-path` as your `:output-dir`
**minus** your webroot directory.

So in our case:

```c
"target/public/cljs-out/dev" - "target/public/" => "cljs-out/dev"
```

If your application can't seem to find the files it needs to load, it
normally means you have a misconfigured `:asset-path`.


## The `:target` option

There are three values for the `:target` option. Actually there are two
values and the absence of a `:target` option. If you don't specify a
`:target` then it will be assumed that our client environment is the
Browser.

The other valid targets are `:nodejs` and `:webworker`.

The `:target` option will change the output of the `:main` bootstrap
script which gets output to the `:ouput-to` file. The script will
handle the environmental needs of loading your ClojureScript code for
that particular environment.

The `:target` option will also change the output code based on what
the environment needs.

Figwheel does not add or change the `:target` option. It will respond
to it and ensure that it starts a `Node` backed REPL if it needs to.

## The `:preloads` option

When we load a ClojureScript application we start at the `:main`
namespace to find all the files that need to be loaded. Sometimes we
want to inject functionality (like REPL support) into our
applications.

The `:preloads` option allows you to inject namespaces into your
runtime environment.

Figwheel takes advantage of this to inject its code into your
environment. You can see this in the `hello-world.core` example
project above. Figwheel appended several `:preloads` to the
configuration:

```clojure
:preloads
 [figwheel.core
  figwheel.main
  figwheel.repl.preload
  devtools.preload
  figwheel.main.evalback]
```

All of these namespaces add additional functionality to your
application. Notice that this is how we add `devtools` and the
`figwheel.repl` connection to your build.

You can add pre-loads as well to add behavior to your development or
production builds.

## The `:closure-defines` option

The `:closure-defines` option is especially powerful. It allows us to
define namespaced constants with `goog-define` and configure their
values in the `:closure-defines` map.

Let's say we want to have `DEBUG` and `LOCALE` variables that we set at
compile time.

```clojure
(ns hello-world.core)

(goog-define DEBUG false)
(goog-define LOCALE "en")
```

> Important: `goog-define` only works with String, Booolean, and Number values.

So we've defined these constants along with their default values. We
can override these default values in our configuration with the
`:closure-defines` option like so:

```
:closure-defines {hello-world.core/DEBUG true
                  hello-world.core/LOCALE "fr"}
```

Figwheel uses `:closure-defines` to supply the connection URL to the
`figwheel.repl` connection code.

You can see in our example above that its value is:

```clojure
:closure-defines
  {figwheel.repl/connect-url
   "ws://localhost:9500/figwheel-connect?fwprocess=b96800&fwbuild=dev"}
```
